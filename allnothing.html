<p>Batch codes appear to represent different levels of toxicity, suggesting that the batches have been labelled with batch codes for the purpose of distinguishing one toxic level from another.</p><br>

<p><b>Pfizer Batches</b></p>
<p>When Pfizer batch codes are arranged alpha-numerically along the x-axis, the following pattern appears -</p><br>


<p><img src="ranges.png"  vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="900" height="450" ></img></p>

<p><br>As you can see batches cluster alphanumerically into specific ranges of toxicity. And these ranges decrease linearly as one ascends the alphabet such that -</p>

<ul >
<li>EN > EP</li><br>
<li>EP > ER</li><br>
<li>ER > EW</li><br><br>
<li>FA > FC</li><br>
<li>FC > FD</li><br>
<li>FD > FE</li><br>
<li>FE > FH</li><br>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>Whether this is deliberate or not is open to debate; it certainly looks deliberate - and it is the common practice of scientists to carefully label each experimental condition inorder to monitor and record the effects. It looks as if batches of varying toxicity have been carefully labelled and tested upon the public - producing different ranges of adverse reactions.</p><br>

<p><b>All or Nothing Phenomenon</b></p><br>
<p><b>Pfizer EN Series</b></p>

<p>In the graph above, take a look at the EN series in turquoise. You will see that there are a cluster of  batches with 2000 to 3000 adverse reactions each - but beneath this cluster is a large empty gap, and finally there are a large number of EN batches very close to the x-axis.</p>

<P>On close examination we find that there are 12 batches in the 2000-3000 range. Then there are 678 batches in the 1-37 range - and nothing inbetween. Take a look at the data below for the EN series. The sudden drop from 2000 down to 37 is remarkable. This pattern of variation in toxicity does not look random, since if it was random we would expect a gradation with shades of toxicity between high and low.</p>
<p>The impression of non-randomness is reinforced by the observation that all of the batches in the 2000-3000 range have the following batch codes -</p>
<p><ul>
<p>EN6198</p>
<p>EN6199</p>
<p>EN6200</p>
<p>EN6201</p>
<p>EN6202</p>
<p>EN6203</p>
<p>EN6204</p>
<p>EN6205</p>
<p>EN6206</p>
<p>EN6207</p>
<p>EN6208</p>
</ul>
</P>
<p>The batch codes are in a perfect mathematical series. It is as if these supertoxic batches were carefully labelled, so that their effects could be monitored and recorded. Here we have 12 batches - each producing 100 times the adverse reactions of the other batches - none of them were recalled by Pfizer - Pfizer allowed these batches to be deployed one after the other.</p><br>

<img src="en-series.png" vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="800" height="800" ></img></p><br>

<P>Exactly the same phenomenon occurs with the EO, ER and EW series. </P><br>

<p><b>Pfizer EW Series</b></p>
<p>In the graph above, take a look at the EW series in green. You will see that there is a cluster of 30 batches producing between 2500-1200 adverse reaction reports, but beneath that there are just 3 batches producing 100-300 adverse reaction reports, then all the remaining batches produce under 22 adverse reaction reports.</p><br>

<P><img src="ew-series.png" vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="600" height="1000" ></img></p><br>

<p> It seems obvious that 30 of the batches are super toxic relative to the rest.</P>
<p>Whatsmore, the batch codes for these 30 batches are -</p><br>
<ul>
<p>EW0150</p>
<p>EW0151</p>
<p>EW0153</p>
<p>EW0158</p>
<p>EW0161</p>

<p>EW0198</p>
<p>EW0202</p>
<p>EW0217</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The batch codes of the super toxic batches are all part of a continuous mathematical series</p><br>

<p><b>Pfizer ER Series</b></p>

<p>In the graph above, take a look at the ER series in yellow. You will see that there is a cluster of 11 batches producing between 1570-3337 adverse reaction reports, but beneath that there , but beneath that all the remaining batches produce 22 or fewer adverse reaction reports.</p><br>

<P><img src="er-series.png" vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="600" height="800" ></img></p><br>

<p> It seems obvious that 11 of the batches are super toxic relative to the rest.</P>
<p>Whatsmore, the batch codes for these 11 batches are -</p><br>
<ul>
<p>ER8727</p>
<p>ER8729</p>
<p>ER8730</p>
<p>ER8731</p>

<p>ER8735</p>
<p>ER8736</p>
<p>ER8737</p>
<p>ER2613</p>
</ul>
</p>
<p>All of the batch codes for these super-toxic batches are part of a continuous mathematical series.</p><br>

<p><b>Pfizer EL Series</b></p>

<p>In the graph above, take a look at the EL series in navy blue. You will see that there is a cluster of batches producing between 1169-2675 adverse reaction reports,  but beneath that there is a rapid and sudden drop in adverse reactions </p><br>

<P><img src="el-series.png" vspace = "0" hspace="0"  ALT="Are some batches more toxic than others?" width="400" height="600" ></img></p><br>

<p>The most toxic batches of the EL series often have batch codes that are part of a mathematical series .</P><br>

<ul>
<p>EL0140</p>
<p>EL0142</p><br>

<p>EL1283</p>
<p>EL1284</p><br>

<p>EL3246</p>

<p>EL9261</p>
<p>EL9262</p>
<p>EL9263</p>
<p>EL9264</p>
<p>EL9265</p>
<p>EL9266</p>
<p>EL9267</p>
<p>EL9269</p>

</ul>
</p>
<p>The batch codes for these super-toxic batches are part of continuous mathematical series.</p><br>

<p><b>What can explain this all-or-nothing variation?</b></p>

<p>I provide the reason for the super toxic batches here - <a href="cdcexpiry3.pdf" target="_blank">CDC Expiry List and Biologically Active Lots</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the batches with low adverse reactions are the placebo/control group. It has been suggested that they are merely misspellings of the highly toxic batches, and therefore they dont really exist. In other words, some people have suggested that all the batches are equally toxic and there are no placebos. Therefore, they conclude that the batches with low adverse reaction numbers must be simply mis-spellings of the toxic batches.</p>

<p>In order to investigate this,  I made a list of all of the batch codes with low adverse reaction numbers for the EL series. The correct format for these batches should be EL followed by 4 digits. I eliminated all batch codes without this format. I was left with 360 batch codes with the correct format but simply with low adverse reactions. These batch codes fell into distinct mathematical series also, and these series were very distinct from the toxic series, for example</p><br>
<ul>
<p>
<p>EL3257</p>
<p>EL3259</p>
<p>EL3262</p>
<p>el3264</p>
<p>EL3265</p>
<p>EL3269</p>
<p>EL3272</p>
<p>EL3274</p>
<p>EL3276</p>
<p>EL3277</p>
<p>EL3283</p>
<p>EL3284</p>
<p>EL3286</p>
<p>EL3287</p>
<p>EL3289</p>
<p>EL3294</p>
<p>EL3297</p>
<p>EL3299</p>
</ul></p>

<p>Analysis of the low toxicity series will undoubtedly reveal some systematisation in the numbers and ranges of these lots. Placebos, just like biologically active lots, would not be issued randomly or without design.</p><br>



<p><b>What are the chances of harm?</b></p>

<p>There were 18 highly toxic batches in the EL series, and 360 low toxic batches. So the ratio of bad batches to good batches is 18: 360 or 1 : 20. Keeping bad batches at the 5% level will keep them just beneath the radar of perception.</P>

<p>If 1 in 20 lots are toxic, and if each person has two vaccine shots each year, then - </p>
<p><ul>
<li>after 1 year their chances of getting a toxic batch will be 1 in 10</li>
<li>after 2 years their chance of getting a toxic batch will be 1in 5</li>
<li>after 3 years their chance of getting a toxic batch will be 1 in 3</li>

</ul></p>
<p>Of course, this assumes that the % of batches that are super-toxic remains constant at 5%.
</p><br>

<p><b>Measuring the Lethality of Different Lots</b></p>
<P>The toxicity of a poison can be determined by its lethality - the % of people who die after taking it. In the PDF  document below, I examine the Pfizer series to see how lethality varies from lot to lot.</P>
